Proof of concept:

File upload progress with node.js and a ruby backend

Running it:

1. Clone the git repository
2. Install node.js (0.1.93) and have the node executable in PATH
3. Install ruby (1.8.7) and bundler (>=0.9.x)
4. bundle install the ruby gem dependencies
5. ./run the server and open http://localhost:8080/
